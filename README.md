## Notice
The error you are encountering suggests that there is a problem with establishing a connection to the server on localhost at port 4444. Here are some possible reasons for this error and their solutions:
- **Server is not running:** Ensure that there is a server application running on localhost listening on port 4444. Without a running server, the client (your SocketExample program) cannot establish a connection.
- **Port is incorrect:** Verify that the server is indeed listening on port 4444. If it is listening on a different port, update your client code to use the correct port.
- **Network issues:** Check for any network issues that might be preventing the connection. This includes firewall settings or other network configurations that might block the connection.
